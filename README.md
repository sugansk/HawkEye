# HawkEye

We are planning to develop a application which helps to identify people trapped in natural disasster zones by flying drones over the zones and identifying humans in real time. When the humans are identified, it sends the location of the humans to the application. Based on the location of the humans, the shortest path to save them is traced accordingly.

We are also planning to create a new layout of the disaster zone by creating a map using the video and image inputs from the drone.
